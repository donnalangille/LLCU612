This exercise demonstrated the importance of stopword lists. The researchers' decision to include, or not include, specific words can potentially have a great effect on the outcomes of performing textual anaylsis on a corpus. My observation of the high frequency words \"would\" and \"could\" might suggest something about the text. To explore further, I could look at the other Austen texts, or other 18th century novels, to see if this word frequency is unique to this novel. "
